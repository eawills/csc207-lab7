# CSC-207 Lab 7: LINQ

LINQ (Language INtegrated Queries) in Java.

This Github repo is mainly just here so we can work separately on functions and
have the wonders of Git take care of merging. Yay!

# Cloning (abriged settings)

Navigate to your eclipse workspace and clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/rayheil/csc207-lab7.git Lab-7
```

(or use SSH if you have it set up, but for one project it won't be worth it)

Then, you'll need to get Eclipse to recognize the project. I think this can be
done along the lines of the following: Use the top menu to navigate to File >
Open Projects from File System and open the 'Lab-7' folder.

Hopefully that all works! If it doesn't I misplanned something terribly, and we
should figure out how to fix it.

At this point you won't have permission to push to the repo, so I'll need to add
you, but these instructions will hopefully get your system connected up
properly.
